Welcome to the **Diabetes Prediction App**. This app predicts the likelihood of an individual having diabetes using a pre-trained **Random Forest Classifier**. The project was developed by **Bernardo Santos** as part of the Machine Learning II course in the Master's in Business Analytics & Big Data at IE University.

### What this means:
- **Class 0 (Non-Diabetic)**: The model demonstrates strong performance, achieving high precision (0.88) and a recall of 0.80, effectively identifying most non-diabetic individuals.
- **Class 1 (Diabetic)**: Performance is slightly lower, with a precision of 0.65 and a recall of 0.77. This indicates the model is better at detecting diabetic cases (fewer false negatives) but has lower precision.
- **Overall**: The weighted average F1-Score of 0.79 reflects balanced performance across both classes, showing noticeable improvement from prior iterations.

**What this means**:
- The training set shows strong classification performance, with 285 correct predictions for Non-Diabetic and 178 for Diabetic. Only a few instances were misclassified.
- This performance aligns with expectations following hyperparameter tuning, indicating the model has learned the training data effectively.

**What this means**:
- Out of 160 actual non-diabetic cases, 124 were correctly classified, while 36 were misclassified as diabetic (False Positives).
- For 71 actual diabetic cases, 56 were correctly classified, and 15 were misclassified as non-diabetic (False Negatives).
- The test set results highlight the model's ability to generalize, showing improvement in identifying diabetic cases compared to earlier iterations.

)
st.write("""
**What this means**:
- The AUC (Area Under the Curve) value is 0.81, indicating that the model has a strong ability to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
- This improvement is a direct result of hyperparameter tuning and grid search, which optimized the Random Forest Classifier to achieve balanced performance across classes.

# Some final comments
st.write("""
The enhancements in metrics and visualizations clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning and grid search. These techniques allowed the model to achieve better precision and recall, particularly for the minority (diabetic) class, addressing class imbalance and reducing overfitting.
