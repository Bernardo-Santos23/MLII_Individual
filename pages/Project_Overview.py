Welcome to the **Diabetes Prediction App**. This app predicts the likelihood of an individual having diabetes using a pre-trained **Random Forest Classifier**. The project was developed by **Bernardo Santos** as part of the Machine Learning II course in the Master's in Business Analytics & Big Data at IE University.

### What this means:
- **Class 0 (Non-Diabetic)**: The model demonstrates strong performance, achieving high precision (0.88) and a recall of 0.77, effectively identifying most non-diabetic individuals.
- **Class 1 (Diabetic)**: Performance is slightly lower, with a precision of 0.60 and a recall of 0.76. This indicates the model is better at detecting diabetic cases (fewer false negatives) but has lower precision.
- **Overall**: The weighted average F1-Score of 0.78 reflects balanced performance across both classes, showing noticeable improvement from prior iterations.

**What this means**:
- The training set shows strong classification performance, with 289 correct predictions for Non-Diabetic and 169 for Diabetic. Only 52 Non-Diabetic and 27 Diabetic samples were misclassified.
- This performance aligns with expectations following hyperparameter tuning, indicating the model has learned the training data effectively.

**What this means**:
- Out of 159 actual Non-Diabetic cases, 123 were correctly classified, while 36 were misclassified as Diabetic (False Positives).
- For 72 actual Diabetic cases, 55 were correctly classified, and 17 were misclassified as Non-Diabetic (False Negatives).
- The test set results highlight the model's ability to generalize while balancing precision and recall effectively.

st.write("""
**What this means**:
- The AUC (Area Under the Curve) value is 0.83, indicating that the model has a strong ability to distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
- This improvement reflects the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning and grid search in optimizing the Random Forest Classifier to achieve better performance across classes.

# Final comments
st.write("""
The enhancements in metrics and visualizations clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning and grid search. These techniques allowed the model to achieve better precision and recall, particularly for the minority (diabetic) class, addressing class imbalance and reducing overfitting.
