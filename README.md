# Diabetes Prediction App

"""
ðŸ©º **Diabetes Prediction App** is a Streamlit-based web application that predicts the likelihood of an individual having diabetes based on key health parameters. 
This project utilizes a pre-trained Random Forest model to classify diabetes likelihood and provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input relevant health metrics.

---

## Project Overview
This project was developed by **Bernardo Santos** from **A-1 Class** as part of the **Machine Learning II** course at the **Master in Business Analytics & Big Data at IE University**. 
It demonstrates the use of a Random Forest model to perform binary classification on health data, allowing users to predict diabetes based on various factors.

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Enter health parameters using intuitive sliders and number inputs.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Click a button to instantly receive a prediction of whether the person is likely to have diabetes.
- **Probability of Prediction**: The app provides the probability that the person has diabetes.
- **Health Parameter Information**: Users can view a detailed description of each health parameter by expanding the information panel.

## Health Parameters Used
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times the individual has been pregnant.
- **Glucose Level**: Blood sugar level in mg/dL.
- **Blood Pressure**: Diastolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
- **Skin Thickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness in mm.
- **Insulin Level**: Blood insulin level in Î¼U/mL.
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index (kg/mÂ²).
- **Diabetes Pedigree Function**: Likelihood of diabetes based on family history.
- **Age**: Age of the individual.
